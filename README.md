# container-stadyn

Version: 1.0

## Short Description

Performs simple statistics on individual samples preparing data for simulation with Isodyn

## Description

“stadyn.R” is an “R”-program that performs a simple statistics on individual samples preparing data for simulation with Isodyn. The aim of this analysis is to have a correct distribution of isotopes originated from substrates that are artificially enriched with specific isotopes (usually 13C). To this end the program performs a correction for natural occurring isotopes and also correction for “impurities” of the assay media that give peaks overlapping with the spectra of analyzed labeled metabolites. This program offers two ways of corrections of “impurities” resulted from overlapping the assayed mass isotopomer distribution with peaks produced either by unknown metabolites in the media, or by different fragments produced by the assayed metabolite. 

## Key features

- primary processing of 13C mass isotopomer data obtained with GCMS

## Functionality

- Preprocessing
- Statistical Analysis
- Workflows

## Approaches

- Isotopic Labelling Analysis / 13C
    
## Instrument Data Types

- MS
- GC-MS

## Data Analysis

- correction for H+ loss produced by electron impact, natural occurring isotopes, and peaks overlapping

## Website

- N/A

## Git Repository

- https://github.com/seliv55/midcor

## Installation  
  
MIDcor is present on all PhenoMeNal Galaxy instances on deployed Cloud Research Environments, under the Fluxomics category in the tool bar to the left of the screen. No installation is needed hence on PhenoMeNal Cloud Research Environments.

For advanced Docker usage:

- Go to the directory where the dockerfile is.
- Create container from dockerfile:

```
docker build -t stadyn .
```

Alternatively, pull directly from the repo 

```
docker pull container-registry.phenomenal-h2020.eu/phnmnl/stadyn
```


## Usage Instructions

On a PhenoMeNal Cloud Research Environment, go to Fluxomics tool category, and then click on midcor, and fill the expected input files, then press Run. Additionally, the tool can be used as part of a workflow with RaMID, Iso2flux and the Escher-Fluxomics tools. On a PhenoMeNal deployed CRE you should find as well a Fluxomics Stationary workflow, which includes MIDcor.

To run MIDcor as a docker image, execute
 
```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/data container-registry.phenomenal-h2020.eu/phnmnl/stadyn -i /data/input.csv -o /data/output.csv
```

To run MIDcor as a docker image created locally:

- using an example, execute

```
docker run -it -v $PWD:/data stadyn -i /data/toIsodyn -f /data/SW620/ -l 3
```

- run test1 using the data that are in the file "ramidout.csv" in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1lAg6jyw6lvSlphUi1mdlUwUXM
 
```
docker run -it --entrypoint=runTest1.sh artimid
```
